# Front-End-Projects
These are all front-end-related projects I've designed so far. These include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as libraries like ReactJs, Bootstrap, jQuery and SASS.

# Survey Form
My first website consisted in a Survey Form in which I put to practise HTML tags related to user input implementation and data processing.

# Tribute Page
Moving on to CSS advanced features, I designed a responsive tribute page from scratch to James Cameron and his work on the wonderful, thriving world of Pandora.

# Tourism Web
Since I was born in Blanes, a fancy, medium-sized city of Catalonia in Costa Brava, I designed another website in which I talk about the landmarks of this awesome village.

# SaberForge
Let's go straight to the point: I love Star Wars. I've loved it since I first watched Episode IV on VHS back in the day with my father. Since I'm also crazy about lightsabers -to the point that I have a replica at home- I designed another responsive web dedicated to lightsabers replica commerce.

# Clock
A futuristic, simple clock I designed using both JavaScript Date Constructor and a manually codeded algorithm I worked on.
