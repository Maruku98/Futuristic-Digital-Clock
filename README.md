# 1. Job Application Form
In my first website, I learned about **HTML forms** and how they work to gather data from the users. I also learned about POST and GET methods, Local Storage and Web Storage, and HTML5 contstraint validation, as well as plenty of **CSS** concepts and properties like the box model. Thus, I designed a job application in which users are expected to attach their resume and fill the required fields.

# 3. Clock
A futuristic, very simple clock I designed using a function that recursively calls JavaScript Date Constructor.
