Hello there!
My name's Marc and I am a Web Developer responsible for the front-end part. I started to know about web delevopment when I first worked in website localization. Since then, I've been continously learning and working on my new projects, which include libraries like React, SASS, jQuery, and Bootstrap. Below you will find the projects I've done so far.

# Job Application Form
In my first website, I learned about HTML forms and how they work to gather data from the users. I also learned about POST and GET methods, Local Storage and Web Storage, and HTML5 contstraint validation, as well as plenty of CSS concepts and properties like the box model. Thus, I designed a job application in which users are expected to attach their resume and fill the required fields.

# Tribute Page
Moving on to CSS advanced features, I designed a responsive tribute page from scratch to James Cameron and his work on the wonderful, thriving world of Pandora.

# Tourism Web
Since I was born in Blanes, a fancy, medium-sized city of Catalonia in Costa Brava, I designed another website in which I talk about the landmarks of this awesome village.

# SaberForge
Let's go straight to the point: I love Star Wars. I've loved it since I first watched Episode IV on VHS back in the day with my father. Since I'm also crazy about lightsabers -to the point that I have a replica at home- I designed another responsive web dedicated to lightsabers replica commerce.

# Clock
A futuristic, simple clock I designed using both JavaScript Date Constructor and a manually codeded algorithm I worked on.
