Hello there!
My name's Marc and I am a front-end Web Developer. I had my first contact with web delevopment when I started working by chance in website localization. Since then, I decided to delve further into that field so I started by studying programming with JavaScript. A fer months later, I began to work on my own projects, which include libraries like **React**, **SASS**, **jQuery**, and **Bootstrap**. Below you will find the projects in which I've worked so far.

# Job Application Form
In my first website, I learned about **HTML forms** and how they work to gather data from the users. I also learned about POST and GET methods, Local Storage and Web Storage, and HTML5 contstraint validation, as well as plenty of **CSS** concepts and properties like the box model. Thus, I designed a job application in which users are expected to attach their resume and fill the required fields.

# Tribute Page
Moving on to more advanced CSS features, I designed a responsive tribute page to **James Cameron** and his background on cinema. You will soon notice that the web was designed from a science fiction perspective.

# Clock
A futuristic, very simple clock I designed using a function that recursively calls JavaScript Date Constructor.

# Roman Numerals Converter
We all learned about Roman Numerals back at school and, since being that old, they have still survived the passing of time! Using JavaScript, I developed a complex algorithm that converts any decimal number below 3,999 to Roman Numerals. There's even a click-to-copy button!
